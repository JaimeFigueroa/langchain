# LangChain Playground  
Im just playing arround with the idea of making an AI agent that can run a simple role playing game as a Game Master. In these repo you'll find some code examples I'll be uploading as I learn this framework.  

Code can be found in the `notebooks` folder.

## Fate SRD
I'll be using the Creative Commons version of Fate SRD (System Reference Document) as example documents.

## Langchain

Langchain is an open source framework to develop applications that use Large Language models (LLMs).

Key concepts:
- **AI Agent**: tool that is able to interact with its environment and gather data. 
- **RAG**: Retrival Augmented Generation is a technique that aims to improve responses generated by the LLM by providing relevant information to the model before it generates its response.
